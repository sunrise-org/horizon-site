# Injections

A function-slot injection is a `[[inject]]` table in `horizon-mod.toml`. It is an escape hatch for a moment
the mod API has no hook for, and **every injection is a request for a hook**: write it so it can become one
by renaming its target, then [ask for the hook](#ask-for-the-hook).

Choose `access = "api"` for API-owned records, or `access = "internals"` for a declared
internals facade. API injections never rebuild the game: a missing prebuilt slot is refused, and source rebuilds and call-site injections require internals access or a hook request. Both use the same `[[inject]]` fields. Native internals listeners use a
compiled slot when available; an unlisted function or supported call requires a source rebuild.
The launcher generates the private horizon-mixins input; mods name a Rust `with` function,
not a source payload file.

An API point injection names a crate-root `with` function and listens at an admitted head or return
slot ([shape rules](#which-functions-are-points)). The prebuilt game fills those slots at load with the
mods' listeners, without changing game source.

There are two access tiers, and they never mix:

- **`access = "api"`: native and `mod.wasm` alike.** A point is a hook whose signature comes from the
  engine function. The listener gets the point's record (and the side's host at a `Game` method's
  point, [below](#which-functions-are-points)): a copy of **every**
  parameter as an API value (scalars, text, std containers, `mod_api` types, and the engine types
  with a `mod_api` mirror, such as `Text` and `BlockStateId`), plus `cancel` or `result`. A `&mut`
  parameter is copied in and its place gets the listener's value back; by-value and `&T` parameters
  run the function with the listener's values. Both targets get the same record and the same
  semantics. A point with a parameter that has no API type yet has no API record: an `api` listener
  there is refused at registration on both targets, naming the parameter and its type.
- **`access = "internals"`: native only.** The listener gets the real receiver and a `&mut` to every
  parameter in its engine type, and the call kinds and support modules below. It is the mixin tier;
  a `mod.wasm` declaring internals or an internals injection is refused at load:
  "internals access is native-only".

## Writing a declaration

An `[[inject]]` needs `id`, `at`, `kind` and `with` (plus `call`, `nth` and `ctx` for a call kind,
copied from the pinned `points.json`). `hash` is optional pinning. Without it, the build takes the
function's fingerprint from the catalog of the game `[native] horizon` pins, which fixes every
signature exactly, and records it in the build's `native-mods.json`. With it, the build checks it
as written and refuses a stale one with `E_INJECT_CHANGED`. The same holds for each `internals`
entry's `hash` (`E_INTERNAL_CHANGED`). Moving the pin with `cargo horizon-mod update` compares the
old and new games for every declaration without a hash: an inject whose function changed refuses the
update with `E_INJECT_CHANGED` until you pass `--accept <inject id>`, as a stale hash refuses the
build, and internals without a hash are reported and stay without one.

Run `cargo horizon-mod inject add <at> --kind <kind> --with <listener>` in a native mod's folder.
The tool appends `[[inject]]`, preserving comments, formatting and permissions. A symlinked
manifest is preserved; edits atomically replace its referent. Checked `[native].horizon` metadata supplies `hash`, pinning it.
`--with` supplies both listener and unique inject id (default `on_inject`); implement it separately.
Access defaults to `api`; edit it to `internals` when needed. The tool prints each tier's availability
at the place, such as `api: refused, argument 2 `batch` (`&mut HudBatch`) has no API type yet` and
`internals: native only`. The launcher validates route support.
Call kinds copy canonical `call`, `nth` and `ctx` from the pinned `points.json`. Use
`--call <canonical callee> --nth N` (default 0, per callee). Omitting `--call` requires one callee
at that ordinal. Ambiguous identities and unlisted source calls are refused; no discovery runs.
Unknown places return `E_INJECT_MISSING` naming the target. Invalid kinds, callbacks,
duplicate ids, or call flags on function kinds leave the manifest untouched.

## Refreshing pinned declarations

`cargo horizon-mod inject update` checks every declaration against the current game's catalogs (a
declaration without a hash has none to refresh);
it does not change `[native].horizon` (use top-level `update` to change that pin).
A unique call context that moved reports `E_INJECT_MOVED` and updates only `nth`.
Missing targets, missing contexts and ambiguous contexts are never retargeted.

Signature changes report `E_INJECT_CHANGED` with old and new hashes and signatures,
including parameters, return type and flags. Older cached catalogs supply the old signature;
when unavailable, the report explicitly says so. No hash changes without explicit consent:
run `cargo horizon-mod inject update --accept <id>` to accept that declaration's new signature.
Repeat `--accept` for multiple ids. Acceptance cannot override missing or lost targets.
Any refused entry prevents all writes. Successful edits preserve unrelated fields and comments,
use atomic replacement, and an exact no-op leaves the file and its modification time untouched.

## Publishing slots to a game checkout

After adding native declarations, request their missing slots in a game source checkout:

```sh
cargo horizon-mod inject sync --repo /path/to/horizon
```

This writes `crates/horizon-mod-api-gen/slots/<mod_id>.txt` in that checkout, not in the mod.
It emits function paths, `at | call | nth | ctx` call rows, and `type <path>` extension rows.
Places already listed by another mod need no duplicate row. Existing rows in your own list
are retained; row-only files and tool-written files are regenerated in sorted order.
A standalone or trailing comment other than the tool's own header prevents rewriting:
the error names its file and line and asks you to move the comment out first.
Running the command again makes no change.

The shared slot parser validates every row before writing. Conflicting call contexts are
refused with both file locations, leaving your file untouched. Invalid mod ids are refused,
including Windows device names (`con`, `nul`, `com1`–`com9`, `lpt1`–`lpt9`, etc.),
and `horizon.txt` is reserved for the engine seed. Commit the generated list with the game
change that supports it; this command does not compile slots or change the mod's build pin.

## Function-slot declarations

API listeners use `access = "api"` (the default) and the host/API record shown below. Native internals
listeners choose `access = "internals"` and the generated facade's receiver/raw record:

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "before_tick"
at = "horizon_client::game::Game<'_>::tick"
kind = "head"
with = "before_tick"
access = "internals"
hash = "<the function hash in internals.json>"
```

The function takes the slot's exact receiver and raw record types from the generated internals
facade. `head` and `return` use function slots. If no compiled slot exists, native internals
listeners use a private source point and rebuild the game; the callback and its facade record path
stay unchanged. The log says `source (private slot, reason)` and private rows are never published
in `points.json`. Targets below `mod_points` are refused because dispatch would create a Cargo cycle.
`before_call`, `after_call`, `modify_value`, `wrap_call` and `wrap_if` also use private source calls
when the canonical callee is absent from every slot list. The launcher validates their exact identity
against the staged SDK before any game build; missing, moved or ambiguous calls refuse. Listed stale
calls never fall back to source. `wrap_call` controls whether and how often to invoke the original;
`wrap_if` runs it only when its condition returns true and requires unit output. The unit check runs
once the private site's metadata exists, before game compilation. For all call kinds, use the catalog's
canonical `call`, `nth` and statement `ctx`, not its place fingerprint `hash`.
The generated `Listener`, `Receiver`, `Args` and `Output` facade names derive from that canonical callee
and are identical on listed and source routes; physical IDs and dispatch remain distinct. The same
`with` function therefore compiles on either route without an alias or compatibility export.
The build log prints `mod:inject: target -> slot (head/return/site, internals)` for each accepted declaration. A changed
hash or missing target is refused, not silently redirected. Points order by descending priority,
then registration (dependency) order; ties within a mod use inject id. Sites retain priority, mod id
and inject id order. To change a function's own arguments, use `head`: its listener gets every argument
to change. To change a call's arguments, use `before_call`: its listener gets them mutably, evaluated,
before the original runs. The old spellings `modify_arg` and `modify_call_arg` are refused, naming these.
An API `replace` owns the function, as a mixin overwrite does: its function takes the head's inputs
and returns the point's return type, which the caller gets, and the body never runs. At a point
returning `()` it returns `()` and the cancel is forced. It runs after the point's other API head
listeners, whatever its priority, so they may change its inputs but not its outcome; internals head
listeners run after it and can't undo it either. A point whose return has no API form refuses it at
load, naming the point and type, and so does one returning `Result<(), E>`, whose cancel would
answer `Ok(())`; a wasm module built without `cargo horizon-mod` is held to the same check when it
loads. A second `replace` at one point is refused at registration, naming both mods. A replacing
mod that stops or is disabled hands the function back: it runs as written again.
Native and wasm share it through `mod_points::replace!`.

An internals `replace` (native only; wasm refuses it at load with the internals refusal) has the same
contract through the point's raw form. Its function takes the real receiver and the raw record,
`&mut` to every argument in its engine type, and returns the function's own return type, `()` at a
unit point, where the cancel is forced:

```rust,ignore
pub fn own_tick(game: &mut internals::game::Game<'_>, raw: &mut internals::raw::__TickRaw<'_>) {
    // the body of `Game::tick` never runs; this does instead
}
```

A free or associated function has no receiver: the function takes the raw record alone. It runs after
every API and internals head listener at the point, whatever its priority: they may change its
arguments, and an internals head that sets `result` or `cancel` before it is overruled by it. One
replace owns a point whatever the tier: an API and an internals replace, or two internals ones, at the
same point refuse the second at registration, naming both mods. A replacing mod that stops or is
disabled hands the function back. The point must be listed with a raw form whose record carries the
outcome: a borrowed return (no raw `result`) and a `Result<(), E>` (whose cancel answers `Ok(())`)
refuse it at load, naming the point and type, and an unlisted function refuses it naming the slot row
to add. The launcher emits it as `mod_points::replace!(internals …)`.
API call sites are refused. Locals and fields use the native source routes described below.
The `native` table accepts only build pins and supporting modules; unknown fields are rejected.
API head/return functions also load from wasm, with the same record.

## For agents

Apply these rules in order and stop at the first that fits.

1. A hook or a Part method exists for the moment: implement it. **No injection.**
2. No hook: an API point declaration. Use `[[inject]]` with `at`, lowercase `kind = "head"` or
   `"return"` and a crate-root `with` function (`hash` is optional pinning). Add `horizon-mod-points` beside
   `horizon-mod-api`; the function takes the side's host and the point's public record. Keep its body
   API-only so the same call can become a hook.
3. You need game internals: declare them and use `access = "internals"` with the generated
   receiver/record types. Native source routing rebuilds the game when no compiled slot exists.
   File a hook request; do not splice a hand-written helper into game source.

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | unique, nonempty |
| `at` | canonical function or target struct path |
| `hash` | optional at a game function or struct: the tool-written signature hash, pinning it; absent, the pinned game's. Required at another mod's point |
| `kind`, `with` | lowercase kind and a crate-root callback function; `field` uses `with` as its member name |
| `access` | `api` (default) or `internals` |
| `type` | required Rust type for `field` and `modify_local`; forbidden for other kinds |
| `priority` | descending; defaults to 0 |
| `call`, `nth`, `ctx` | exact canonical callee, occurrence and statement context for a call kind |

Function-slot errors name the declaration or target. The generated constructor checks the callback's
signature. Freshness errors never redirect an injection to a different function or call.

Naming: events and methods follow NeoForge 26.3 names with no `on_` prefix; the event is `&mut`, handles come from
the event, and writes take `host`.

## The decision ladder

1. **A hook or Part method exists: use it.** Read [Hooks](concepts/trait-mods.md) and the
   [rustdoc](reference/api.md). A per-block, per-item or per-entity moment is a Part method. Nothing in this
   chapter applies.
2. **No hook: an API `[[inject]]` function.** The default. Your crate-root function gets the side's host
   and the point's record (`mod_points::<Point>Args`): every argument as an API value, and a
   `cancel` or `result` where the function returns `()` or an API value. It uses only `mod_api` types.
   Every `Game` method is a point on both routes: the prebuilt game was built with them all, and a source
   build gets the same points, so a point injection builds against the prebuilt game.
3. **You truly need private internals:** declare their paths and fingerprints, then choose
   `access = "internals"`. The callback depends on that game build, not a stable API contract;
   it remains a hook request. A missing compiled slot requires a native source rebuild.

## The forms

| Form | Where | Game rebuild | `mod.wasm` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API `[[inject]]` | admitted head/return slots | no | yes |
| Internals `[[inject]]` | head/return slots and supported call sites | only without a compiled slot | no (refused at load) |
| Hook or Part method (no injection) | its documented firing point | no | yes |

## Ordering

Head slots run before head source callbacks; return source callbacks run before return slots.
Slots run API listeners before internals listeners. Within each phase priority descends, then
stable dependency/registration order; inject id breaks ties within one mod. A call wrapper may
invoke the original zero, one or several times. A head cancellation skips the body and the return
point, not the listeners after it: every head listener runs and sees `cancel` as the ones before it
left it, and one may clear it again. Return listeners observe the result only after the body actually
ran. Trait-mod hooks run by `#[listener]`
priority descending, then dependency order; a cancel skips later mods except those receiving cancelled
events, which may undo it. Hook contracts determine their own cancellation and replacement rules.

## Make your injection convertible

An injection becomes a hook when its body is a single call a hook can take. Keep to four rules:

- **Take the host**, never `&mut Game`.
- **Never read `Game` fields.** Whatever you need comes from handles, attachments and services reached from the
  host.
- **One call.** Keep the body to a single call into your own code, so the hook's listener is that call.
- **One injection per moment.** Two injections at a moment are two hook requests.

Counting server ticks in an attachment needs no game internals. Prefer an API point until the
matching hook exists; use exactly the same API-only call in either form.

**1. A point injection** (the default). `Game::tick` is a point, so this builds on the prebuilt game. The
mod depends on `horizon-mod-points` as well as `horizon-mod-api`:

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "count"
at = "horizon_client::game::Game<'_>::tick"
kind = "head"
with = "tick"
hash = "98019f886ec32cc7"
```

```rust,ignore
pub fn tick(host: HostSide<'_>, _: &mut TickArgs) {
    if let HostSide::Server(host) = host {
        let _ = count(host);
    }
}

#[mod_api::horizon_mod]
impl Hooks for Mod {}
```

**2. The hook it becomes.** Say the catalog has a hook at that moment (the `server_tick` hook, which fires every server tick, stands in here), so the injection disappears and the
mod implements the hook. The listener body is the same call:

```rust,ignore
#[mod_api::horizon_mod]
impl Hooks for Mod {
    fn server_tick(&self, host: &mut dyn ServerHost, _: &mut ServerTickEvent<'_>) {
        let _ = count(host);
    }
}
```

```rust,ignore
fn count(host: &mut dyn ServerHost) -> Result<(), AttachmentError> {
    let old = COUNTER.get(&mut *host, Holder::Level)?;
    COUNTER.set(host, Holder::Level, old + 1)
}
```

The `COUNTER` attachment is the same in both:

```rust,ignore
/// A counter on the level, saved with the world.
static COUNTER: AttachmentType<i32> = AttachmentType {
    namespace: "example",
    name: "counter",
    default: || 0,
    codec: None,
    copy_on_death: false,
    sync: false,
};
```

Moving from the point to the hook keeps the same call: the function body becomes the hook's body, and its record becomes the hook's event. That is what "convertible" means, and why shape 2 is the default.

## Ask for the hook

A gap is a hook request. File one as an issue on
[arismoko/horizon](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues) with the contract below.
Copy this, and fill every field:

```markdown
**Hook request: <short name>**

- **What the mod needs:** <one sentence: the moment, and what the mod does there>
- **NeoForge 26.3 counterpart:** <event or method name, or "none">
- **Vanilla class and method:** <`net.minecraft…Class.method`, the call the hook wraps>
- **The injection it replaces:** <the `[[inject]]` table, `at`, `kind`, `access` and callback signature>
- **Mod:** <name, repository or `.hmod`>
- **Side:** <server, client or both>
- **Contract wanted:** <listen, cancel, replace a value, collect; what a listener may change>
```

A hook with a NeoForge counterpart takes its name, side and contract. One without is welcome and names the
mod mixin or use it replaces. State the vanilla method: the hook fires where vanilla calls it.

## The build log

The launcher reports each unified declaration's target, access and selected slot/source route.
A source route means a game rebuild, not a fallback after failed freshness checks. Compiler
errors name the callback registration or source adapter. Inspect `native/build.log` for the
mod and inject id rather than guessing which callback filled a slot.

A panic inside a point listener reports the mod and the method
(`in native mod <id>, hook <method>`).

## Support modules

A `[[native.module]]` table contributes a whole Rust module to a game crate, beside the injections:
self-contained items for source-level support code. It is the shape
for support code a moment needs and one function cannot hold — Portizon's runtime is the case that
asked for it.

```toml
[[native.module]]
id = "runtime"
file = "crates/horizon-client/src/game.rs"
name = "portizon"
source = "src/runtime.rs"
visibility = "pub"          # optional: "pub" or "pub(crate)" (the default)
```

`source` holds the module's items without an outer wrapper; the tool emits them into `file` as
`mod name`. The destination file must carry no top-level glob import — horizon-mixins refuses one,
because it cannot prove which names the glob introduces — and the payload must be self-contained: no
`mod` items, `#[path]`, `include!` or file attributes; assemble multi-file code into one file first.
Ids are unique across a package's injections and modules together.

Modules are **native-only** and last-resort support code, outside the `mod_api`-only
line: a mod's behaviour still goes through hooks, handles and Parts. Any capability a module needs
that the API lacks is a hook request in #44's row form, not a reason to grow the module.

## Which functions are points

Every function of the game module is a point: `Game` methods, methods of its other types (`GameLevel`,
`Levels`…), associated functions and free functions. A crate below the game adds the functions
`crates/horizon-mod-api-gen/slots/<mod_id>.txt` lists, one path per line (`horizon_client_render::chunk::Chunk::get`);
each one there is measured first, since a slot on a hot function costs on every call. Left out:

- the hook functions themselves (`native_*`), which are hooks;
- a function compiled only under a `cfg`, and one in a `cfg`-gated module;
- `const`, `async` and `unsafe` functions, and methods that take `self` by value;
- `impl Trait` or `!` in the signature, `#[inline(always)]`, and a parameter named `cancel` or `result`.

A `Game` method that takes `self` has a point named after the method (`tick`). Any other is named by its full path, snake-cased
without `horizon_client::`: `game_levels_levels_parked_dims` for `Levels::parked_dims`, and for a lower
crate without `horizon_`: `client_render_chunk_chunk_get`, and `Game::new` is `game_game_new`. `Game` methods'
points get a host; free and associated functions have none.
A point name is always one snake-cased form, for engine and mod points alike. Snake-casing is not injective
(`a::b_c` and `a_b::c` are both `a_b_c`), so uniqueness comes from refusal: the build fails, naming both
functions, when two points have one name. A method of another type has no API
record until `mod_api` has a handle for that type; it keeps its internals form.

A method whose return value borrows the game (`-> &T`, `-> Option<&mut T>`) has a head and no API
return. A `usize` or `isize` crosses the record as `u64` or `i64`, one width for native and wasm
listeners. A `&[T]` parameter is copied as a `Vec<T>`, and `&str` as text a listener may replace. A
value a mirror can't convert at a call skips that call's API listeners, logged; a listener's value
the engine refuses leaves the engine's own in place, logged. Mod input never panics the game.

`points.json` gives each point's `api_refusal`: absent when it has an API record, else the first
parameter with no API type, as the registration refusal states it.

**The raw form (internals).** A point whose signature has no type or const generics and no `impl Trait` also has a raw
form: a native listener that gets the real receiver and a `&mut` to every argument in its own type,
internal types included, with `cancel` or `result` to stop the body. Its return listener gets the value
returned, a borrowed one included (`&mut &mut T`), where the API form has no return. The launcher's
generated `main` registers raw listeners by type; declaring them in `horizon-mod.toml` comes with the
per-mod internals list.
`points.json`, beside the prebuilt game, lists them all; the rustdoc of `horizon-mod-points` documents
each with the function it listens at.

The source tree carries no `#[point]`: the build of the prebuilt game, and the launcher's source builds,
put one on each method in the copy they compile. A plain `cargo build` of the game in a checkout has no
points; a mod listening there builds, and its listeners never fire.

## Mod points: patching another mod

A mod's own functions are points too ([#2339](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/2339)),
by the same rules as the game's: every eligible function of the crate, public and private, free
functions, inherent methods and functions of inline modules (trait impl methods are not points). The
build compiles a staged copy with a point on each, in a slot table of the mod's own
(`<crate>::__horizon_points`); the author's source is never edited. A point is named by its path
from the crate root, snake-cased: `tanks_tank_fill` for `chemlib::tanks::Tank::fill`. Two functions whose
paths give one name (`a::b_c` and `a_b::c`) fail the build, naming both; rename one or opt it out.
A library's crate must be named after its mod id, with `-` as `_` (`chem-lib` builds crate
`chem_lib`): an addon's manifest names the library by id and each `at` by crate, and on both
targets the points of a library whose crate is named otherwise are refused.

- **Opting out.** `#[mod_api::no_point]` on a function gives it no point. An addon declaring a
  listener there is refused: `chemlib::audit has no point (opted out with #[mod_api::no_point])`.
- **Declaring.** An addon depends on the library and pins the function with
  `cargo horizon-mod inject add chemlib::transfer --kind head --with double_rate`, exactly as for
  the game's points: `at` is the function's path in its crate.
- **`access = "api"`.** The listener gets the point's record, `<crate>::__horizon_points::<Point>Args`:
  a copy of every parameter, `&mut` ones copied back, and `cancel` or `result`. Every parameter needs
  a `Wire` form: scalars, text, std containers, `mod_api`'s types, and the library's own publicly
  reachable types that carry `#[derive(mod_api::Wire)]`. Nothing adds the derive; a parameter without one refuses the
  point's API listeners, naming it. A method of the library's own types has no API record (its
  `self` has no handle), as on the game.
- **No Host.** As on the game, only a `Game` method's point gets a `Host`; free functions and
  methods of other types get none, and a mod crate's functions have no `Game` receiver. A mod
  point's `api` listener gets its record and nothing else; an addon that acts on the game does it
  from its own hooks, which get a `Host`.
- **`access = "internals"`.** The listener gets the receiver and every parameter by reference, in
  their own types, through the raw form declared beside the function. It works from the library's
  own target: the same binary on native, the same dependency group on wasm. A wasm listener
  at a declared dependency's point needs no engine internals declaration. The group registers
  listeners through typed functions exported by the library, then seals every library registry
  before initialization; each member keeps its own `mod_api` copy.
- **The signature check.** Each mod point's hash covers its path, its signature as written and its
  record's field types. When the library's function changes, the addon is refused at load:
  `E_INJECT_CHANGED: addon:double_rate: chemlib 1.1.0 changed chemlib::transfer: pinned …, installed …
  (signature)`. `cargo horizon-mod inject update` reports the change and repins with `--accept`.
- **Across targets.** A native library with a wasm addon, or the reverse, is refused at load. A native
  addon's listener at a wasm library's point says why it can never cross: "internals access to chemlib
  needs the same target", or an `api` listener on a parameter without a `Wire` form, naming it. Any
  other mixed edge gets the general refusal, "mixed native and wasm dependencies aren't supported yet"
  ([Wire types](how-to/wire-types.md)).
- **Cost when nothing listens.** One relaxed load of the place's slot and a branch at the head, one
  more for the return; the listened path stays out of line. On the chemicals fixture's per-tick
  transfer (a ~2 ns function) that is about 1.2 ns a call natively and 1.6–2 ns on wasm.

The build writes the mod's points to `mod-points.json` in a wasm package and pins its SHA-512 in
the manifest's `[wasm] points`; a package whose `mod-points.json` is missing, unpinned or changed is
refused.
The launcher lists a native mod's points from its source.

## Raw listeners and declared internals

When an API-typed point cannot carry the state a mod needs, a native mod can declare game
internals and a raw listener. Each internal is an API request: propose the missing hook, handle
or Part on the [roadmap](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/771) so the mod can move back
to the typed API.

```toml
internals = [
    { path = "horizon_client::game::Game", hash = "<written by the tool>" },
    { path = "horizon_client::game::native_ticks::TickRound::listening", kind = "method", hash = "<written by the tool>" },
]

[native]
game = "26.3"
horizon = "<exact game commit>"
mixins = "<exact mixins commit>"

[[inject]]
id = "count"
at = "horizon_client::game::Game<'_>::tick"
kind = "head"
with = "count"
access = "internals"
hash = "<written by inject add>"
```

Run `cargo horizon-mod internals sync` in the mod's folder after editing its Rust code. It
checks the mod against a discovery-only copy of the pinned game's source, uses compiler
warnings to find actual internal uses (including glob imports and macros), and replaces
top-level `internals` with their exact paths, kinds and hashes. Unused declarations are removed;
retained declarations keep their formatting. The command prints added and removed entries.
It is explicit: a normal build never changes the declarations reviewers and players read.

Install `horizon-launcher` on `PATH`, or set `HORIZON_LAUNCHER` to its executable. The command
invokes `horizon-launcher native-build --sync-internals <mod folder> --trust-native-code`, whose
stdout is a JSON list of discovered catalog entries for the tool. This runs `cargo check`, not
the game, but Rust build scripts and procedural macros execute with your rights: run it only
on code you trust. No installed game or instance is needed. The launcher caches the isolated
source and metadata build per pin under `native/internals-sync/<commit>/`; the second check
reuses those compiler outputs. Neither that cache nor its temporary diagnostic attributes is
used by normal builds or published prebuilt games. The source must be cached or downloadable;
`E_INTERNAL_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` explains when it cannot be obtained, without changing the
manifest or falling back to a different pin. Any compiler or catalog error also leaves the
manifest alone. Discovery checks the mod's library on the current host with default features;
configuration-gated catalog entries are still refused. Mods with source-spliced helper files
or source listeners are refused with `E_INTERNAL_SOURCE_INJECTION`: declare their internals
explicitly with `internals add` instead. This invocation stages one mod project; required mod
dependencies that are not in that project are refused by the dependency resolver, not silently
omitted.

### Discovering module items

`internals add`, `inject add` and `internals sync` discover items in the mod's own
`[[native.module]]` tables. Module discovery downloads the pinned game source and uses the
launcher's managed Rust toolchain and pinned horizon-mixins, with the same module application
as a native source build. Install `horizon-launcher` on PATH or set `HORIZON_LAUNCHER`.
The cargo tools request the catalog pair using `native-build --catalog --trust-native-code`.
The launcher applies only this mod's modules to a fresh source copy before discovery staging;
it never applies modules to an already staged tree. Each invocation regenerates module catalogs,
so editing a module cannot reuse stale fingerprints. Paths refer to the destination game crate,
for example `horizon_client::game::ported_level::PortedGame::tick`, including in `with` callback declarations.
Mods without modules retain the pinned prebuilt catalog path for the cargo add commands.
Compiler discovery still refuses source listeners that require source rewriting.

`cargo horizon-mod internals add <path>` remains useful for those explicit declarations and
writes the path and hash from the pinned game's `internals.json`; don't invent hashes. When several member kinds share a path (such as a field
and a method named `listening`), pass `--kind <kind>` to select the catalog entry, for example
`cargo horizon-mod internals add horizon_client::game::native_ticks::TickRound::listening --kind method`.
The tool reports the available kinds if the choice is missing and writes the resolved `kind`
into each added declaration, even for unambiguous paths. A declaration may omit `kind` only
when its path has a single kind. Kind names match `internals.json`: inherent methods use `method`, free
functions use `fn`, and fields use `field`. A `--kind` applies to all paths in that invocation.
`cargo horizon-mod update` shows the signature changes and refreshes hashes while retaining
member kinds. Use `cargo horizon-mod inject add` to select the target and write a unified
injection with its function hash. `with` names the callback in the mod's crate root.

Depend on `horizon-internals` (library `internals`) at the same pin as `horizon-mod-api`, never
on `horizon-client` directly. The build generates a facade for this mod alone. Its nested
modules re-export declared types and free functions: the declaration above makes
`internals::game::Game` available. Declaring a field or inherent method exports its owner type;
a type necessarily brings all its public fields and inherent methods. Undeclared types have no
name in the facade and do not compile.

The facade is generated when the game builds the mod, and it re-exports items the prebuilt
game makes public; the game's source keeps them private. So a plain `cargo check` of the
mod resolves `horizon-internals` to an empty crate and can't see `internals::…`. Compile
a mod that declares internals with `horizon-launcher native-build <mod folder>`, which stages it
against the pinned game the same way the launcher does on install, and report its errors.

A raw injection also exposes the point's listener and raw record in `internals::raw`, for
example `__TickListener` and `__TickRaw`. Discovery keeps those same typed exports and does
not change `[[inject]]`; slot listeners need no special sync step. Implement `pub fn count` with the exact listener type
from `points.json` (including the receiver and argument-record lifetime). The facade's safe,
typed `raw::tick` constructor registers it in the generated executable; a mismatched function
fails at that registration line, naming the injection. `return` uses the point's return
listener and `raw::tick_return` constructor. Raw listeners work against the prebuilt game as
well as source builds; unlisted source points and modules require a game rebuild.

Native slot and source routes check the actual game's metadata before compiling mods:

- `E_INTERNAL_MISSING`: the declared path is absent (type shapes not exposed as internals
  cannot be declared). Run `cargo horizon-mod internals sync` to discover this pin's used
  internals. Undeclared-item compiler errors also point to this command.
- `E_INTERNAL_CHANGED`: the hash changed; the error names the new signature and asks for
  `cargo horizon-mod update`.
- `E_INTERNAL_AMBIGUOUS`: several member kinds share the path; choose one of the listed kinds
  with `internals add <path> --kind <kind>`.
- `E_INTERNAL_GATED`: the entry exists only under a `cfg`; target-specific declarations are
  not supported.
- `E_NOT_RAW`: the injection's target has no raw form, for example because it is generic or
  takes `impl Trait`.
- `E_GAME_DEPENDENCY`: the mod depends directly on `horizon-client`; use the facade instead.
- `E_INTERNAL_PATH`: the entry cannot be re-exported as an item, for example an entire module;
  declare its types or free functions instead.

The build log lists each mod's internals and raw places. The same information is recorded in
`native-mods.json` beside the built game.

### Listed call sites (native only)

An internals `[[inject]]` with `call`, `nth` and `ctx` wraps that exact call, not the enclosing function. Both native
build routes use the same `points.json` object: `points` lists function points and `sites` lists
call sites. Only reviewed call entries in `crates/horizon-mod-api-gen/slots/<mod_id>.txt` become sites:

```text
horizon_client::game::Game<'_>::next_autosave_interval | autosave_interval | 0 | <ctx from points.json>
```

Each slot list accepts a function path, `at | call | nth | ctx`, or `type <path>` (a type listing; field declarations are source-only). Files support `#` comments; identical declarations merge, and conflicting
contexts name both files. The stage reads their sorted union, evaluates the receiver once, and rewrites
only the selected call expression in its copy of the game.

Call identity uses the resolved callee path, not its spelling: aliases and different receivers of the
same type share one ordinal sequence. Ordinals count runtime calls in source order; constant contexts
and nested item bodies are not selected. `points.json` publishes each site's resolved `call`, `ctx`,
and `hash`. The fingerprint includes the callee path and signatures. `ctx` hashes the containing
statement's tokens and its block/if/match-arm path, ignoring source formatting. Empty contexts are
for tool discovery only; copy the generated context when listing a slot, never invent one.

A unique matching context at another ordinal refuses with `E_INJECT_MOVED`, naming the new `nth`.
A changed or missing context refuses with `E_INJECT_LOST`. Two calls to the same callee with identical
contexts are also lost, even when `nth` still matches: the tool cannot prove which identical statement
was intended. Refresh a moved ordinal with `inject update`; reselect a lost call with `inject add`.
Function signature changes and missing functions use `E_INJECT_CHANGED` and `E_INJECT_MISSING` at the
unified routing boundary. `E_INJECT_NO_SLOT` reports an unsupported route or kind, with its reason
and requested slot declaration. `E_INJECT_INVALID` reports malformed declaration fields.
Freshness errors never silently select a different call.

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "autosave"
at = "horizon_client::game::Game<'_>::next_autosave_interval"
kind = "modify_value"
with = "autosave"
access = "internals"
hash = "<function hash written by inject add>"
call = "horizon_client::game::autosave_interval"
nth = 0
ctx = "<statement context written by inject add>"
```

The facade's `internals::raw` module exports this site's exact `Args`, `Receiver`, `Output` and
`Listener` aliases and a typed registration constructor, all named from the canonical callee (the same names on slot and source routes).
Use those aliases for the callback. The generated main adapts each kind to one wrap listener:

| Kind | Callback inputs and result |
| --- | --- |
| `before_call` | Receiver and mutable arguments; runs before the original call |
| `after_call` | Receiver and a shared reference to the result; keeps that result |
| `modify_value` | Receiver and the result by value; returns the replacement |
| `wrap_call` | Receiver, mutable arguments and mutable `original` continuation; returns the result |
| `wrap_if` | Receiver and shared arguments; returns whether to call the original; unit output only |

Native `internals` calls on both listed and source routes admit immutable borrowed arguments, such as `&str`.
Their generated `Args<'a>` record borrows the original values for the call; no implicit
owned-string conversion occurs. The listener is higher-ranked over that lifetime, so safe
callbacks cannot retain the record or its references beyond the call, or mutate the referent
through an immutable reference (ordinary interior mutability still follows Rust's rules).
A callback may replace an argument with another reference valid for the same lifetime.
Engine types are borrowed too: `&MobWorld` becomes a shared reference to the native
`horizon_client_lib::mobs::MobWorld<'g>` in `Args<'g, 'a>`, keeping the world's own
lifetime separate from the record's borrow. The facade re-exports the typed record;
it does not convert the world into a mod API value or expose private fields. A callback
can read the world's public fields and call its shared-reference methods using Rust's
normal field projection, including public nested values, even without naming every type.
Naming `MobWorld` itself requires its internals facade export. It cannot obtain exclusive
access or extend either lifetime. Copy arrays of scalar values, such as `[i32; 3]`, can
accompany these references in either route's records.
`modify_value` still receives only the receiver and owned result, not the argument record.
Mutable borrowed arguments remain refused, as do borrowed arguments on API routes;
this does not enable API source adapters or wasm call sites.

### Owned arguments on native calls

A native `internals` call on either route can also move owned arguments, such as the `ItemStack`
in `Game::dispense_item`, into its record. Argument expressions run once in their original
order. No stack is implicitly cloned. A record with any owned non-Copy field selects the
**single-use** listener contract; named value types are conservatively treated as owned,
even when that particular type implements Copy. Non-generic private aliases are expanded
from the catalog, so the record names the actual field types rather than an inaccessible alias
in another implementation module. The existing scalar/shared-reference-only
contract remains repeatable.

`before_call` still receives `&mut Args`, allowing argument modification; an observing
callback can inspect its fields through shared references. `after_call` and `modify_value`
keep their result-only signatures. A single-use `wrap_call` instead receives `Args` **by
value** and the site's generated `Original<'g, 'a, 'next>` capability (exported beside
`Args`, `Receiver`, `Output` and `Listener` under the same canonical prefix):

```rust,ignore
pub fn wrap(receiver: Receiver<'_, '_>, mut args: Args, original: Original<'_, '_, '_>) -> Output {
    inspect(&args.stack);
    modify(&mut args.stack);
    original.call(receiver, args)
}
```

`original.call` consumes both the forwarding capability and the record. A second call,
using the moved record again, or retaining the capability past this call fails to compile.
A wrapper that does not forward must supply its own correctly typed output; its unconsumed
arguments drop normally. `wrap_if` remains unit-output-only and drops the arguments when
its condition is false. Panics unwind through ordinary Rust ownership: a value is not leaked
or dropped twice by the engine, whether the listener panics before or after forwarding.
No per-call heap allocation is needed for the capability.

Borrowed and owned fields share one lifetime-bearing record. Forwarding moves owned fields
and copies shared references; dropping the record does not drop their referents. Native
`internals` callbacks are trusted code, not a sandbox: a callback may explicitly take an
owned value through replacement or by owning Args, and may call `mem::forget`. The engine
promises no hidden copies or leaks; it cannot prohibit these explicit mod-side transfers.
Mutable-reference arguments and API/wasm routes remain refused.
A reviewed call row compiles the same typed record into the prebuilt game. Attaching a
listener to that listed site does not rebuild the game, and uses the same listener source
and lifetime rules as source routing. A stale listed declaration is refused by name;
it never falls back to a source build.

The reviewed Portizon rows use the catalog's physical caller paths:
- `horizon_client_lib::mobs::villager_brain::secondary::sense_secondary`: `farmland`, ordinal 0;
- `horizon_client::game::sign_edit::Game<'_>::draw_sign_editor`: `editor_sprite`, ordinals 0 and 1;
- `horizon_client::game::machines::Game<'_>::dispense_from`: `Game::dispense_item`, ordinal 0.

Use these caller paths in the manifest. The nominal `horizon_client::game::Game::...`
caller spelling is currently refused as Missing by the loader; listing a call does not
add a nominal alias or change identity matching.

With no listener, these sites cost what every already-listed site costs: one relaxed
atomic load and a branch, without constructing Args or allocating. This is not literally
zero overhead relative to an uninstrumented call. An optimized author benchmark on an
Intel Core i9-13900H measured 1.44 ns per plain call versus 1.93 ns per unsubscribed listed
call, a difference of +0.49 ns per call (six alternating samples of 50 million calls,
with the subscription flag opaque to the optimizer). Run the generator's ignored
`unsubscribed_listed_call_cost` test to reproduce the measurement on another machine.

Owned shapes containing further borrows remain refused; direct immutable-reference fields
can accompany owned fields.

Listeners nest by descending priority, then mod ID, then injection ID; the first is outermost.
A repeatable wrap may call `original` zero, one or several times; a single-use wrap forwards
at most once. `cancellable` is refused: returning from the caller is not a call-site operation. Borrowing results, non-record arguments, ambiguous targets
and alias-dependent receiver arguments are refused with the declaration's file, line and reason.

An unlisted canonical call can use native source routing after the same freshness checks.
A listed stale call never falls back to source. Use the function hash and statement context,
not a site's physical fingerprint, as the declaration identity. `wrap_if` needs unit output.
These call kinds are not available to wasm mods.

## From mixins and legacy kinds

Each Mixin injector, and each kind of the removed `[[native.injection]]` helper form, has one
`[[inject]]` form. Two rules come first:

- **A hook function is not a point: implement the hook.** Where the catalog has a hook for the
  moment, a mixin there becomes a `mod_api::Hooks` method, not an injection. `native_*` functions are
  left out of points on purpose.
- **Mixins are internals.** Call-site kinds, internals `replace` and the raw listeners need
  `access = "internals"` and are native only: a `mod.wasm` declaring them is refused at load. Only
  `head`, `return` and `replace` have an `access = "api"` form.

`at`, `hash`, `call`, `nth` and `ctx` in the examples are written by `cargo horizon-mod inject add`.
Each callback's types come from the mod's facade (`internals::raw`).

| Mixin injector | Legacy kind | `[[inject]]` form | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@Inject(at = @At("HEAD"))` | `HEAD` | `kind = "head"` | [head](#head) |
| `@Inject(at = @At("RETURN"))`, `TAIL` | `RETURN` | `kind = "return"` | [return](#return) |
| `@Inject(at = @At("INVOKE"))` | `BEFORE_CALL` | `kind = "before_call"` | [before_call](#before_call) |
| `@Inject(at = @At(value = "INVOKE", shift = AFTER))` | `AFTER_CALL` | `kind = "after_call"` | [after_call](#after_call) |
| `@Inject(at = @At("INVOKE_ASSIGN"))` | `AFTER_ASSIGN` | `kind = "after_call"` (read), `"modify_value"` (change) | [after-assign](#after-assign) |
| `@Overwrite` | `OVERWRITE` | `kind = "replace"` | [replace](#replace) |
| `@ModifyArg` | `MODIFY_ARG` | `kind = "before_call"` | [one call argument](#one-call-argument) |
| `@ModifyArgs` | `MODIFY_ARGS` | `kind = "before_call"` | [all call arguments](#all-call-arguments) |
| `@ModifyVariable` on a parameter | `MODIFY_VARIABLE` | `kind = "head"` | [a parameter](#a-parameter) |
| `@ModifyVariable` on a local | `MODIFY_VARIABLE` | `kind = "modify_local"` | [a local](#a-local) |
| `@ModifyConstant` | `MODIFY_CONSTANT` | `kind = "expression"` | [constants and field reads](#constants-and-field-reads) |
| `@ModifyExpressionValue` on a call | `MODIFY_EXPRESSION_VALUE` | `kind = "modify_value"` | [modify_value](#modify_value) |
| `@ModifyExpressionValue` on a field read | `MODIFY_EXPRESSION_VALUE` | `kind = "expression"` | [constants and field reads](#constants-and-field-reads) |
| `@WrapOperation`, `@Redirect` | `WRAP_OPERATION` | `kind = "wrap_call"` | [wrap_call](#wrap_call) |
| `@WrapWithCondition` | `WrapWithCondition` | `kind = "wrap_if"` | [wrap_if](#wrap_if) |
| `@Unique` fields | state fields | `kind = "field"` (pending: #2582) | [state](#state) |
| support classes | support modules | `[[native.module]]` | [support classes](#support-classes) |
| `@Shadow`, `@Accessor`, `@Invoker` | `bindings` | declared `internals` | [bindings](#bindings) |

"Pending" kinds parse, and are refused with a typed `E_INJECT_NO_SLOT` reason until the PR named
lands.

The call kinds below share one site; this declaration is written for each (only `kind` and `with`
change):

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "autosave"
at = "horizon_client::game::Game<'_>::next_autosave_interval"
kind = "before_call"
with = "autosave"
access = "internals"
hash = "<function hash>"
call = "horizon_client::game::autosave_interval"
nth = 0
ctx = "<statement context>"
```

The site's aliases are named from the callee (here `__…AutosaveIntervalReceiver`, `…Args`, `…Output`);
the examples shorten them to `Receiver`, `Args` and `Output`.

### head

Runs before the body, with every argument. The API form gets the side's host and the point's record;
the internals form gets the receiver and the raw record. Setting `cancel` (or `result`) skips the body.

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "tick"
at = "horizon_client::game::Game<'_>::tick"
kind = "head"
with = "tick"
hash = "<function hash>"
```

```rust,ignore
pub fn tick(host: mod_api::HostSide<'_>, args: &mut mod_points::TickArgs) {
    my_mod::count(host);
}
```

### return

Runs after the body with the value returned, which it may change (`args.result` in the API form, the
value itself in the raw form). `kind = "return"`, otherwise as [head](#head):

```rust,ignore
pub fn wrap(args: &mut mod_points::GameCommandsWrapDegreesArgs) {
    if let Some(angle) = &mut args.result {
        *angle = angle.round();
    }
}
```

### before_call

Runs just before the call, after its arguments are evaluated, with the receiver and the arguments
mutably:

```rust,ignore
pub fn autosave(receiver: Receiver<'_, '_>, args: &mut Args) {
    my_mod::note_rate(args.rate);
}
```

### after_call

Runs just after the call with its result, which the caller still gets unchanged (`kind = "after_call"`):

```rust,ignore
pub fn autosave(receiver: Receiver<'_, '_>, value: &Output) {
    my_mod::record_interval(*value);
}
```

### after-assign

`INVOKE_ASSIGN` fires right after the call's value is stored into a local. In Rust,
`let interval = autosave_interval(…);` moves the value into the binding with nothing in between, so
[after_call](#after_call) sees exactly the value assigned, and [modify_value](#modify_value) changes
what is assigned. Other locals in scope are [modify_local](#a-local)'s.

### modify_value

Takes the call's result by value and returns the one the caller gets (`kind = "modify_value"`):

```rust,ignore
pub fn autosave(receiver: Receiver<'_, '_>, value: Output) -> Output {
    value * 2
}
```

### replace

Owns the function: the body never runs, and the function's value is the listener's. One replace per
point, whatever the tier. The API form takes the record and returns the record's `result` type;
the internals form takes the receiver and raw record and returns the function's own type:

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "average"
at = "horizon_client::game::blocks::beacon::average"
kind = "replace"
with = "average"
access = "internals"
hash = "<function hash>"
```

```rust,ignore
pub fn average(raw: &mut internals::raw::__GameBeaconAverageRaw<'_, u32, u32, u32>) -> u32 {
    (*raw.a).max(*raw.b)
}
```

Unlike a mixin `@WrapOperation`, a replace has no `original` to continue into: the body is gone for
as long as it owns the point. Calling the replaced function from the listener doesn't reach the
body; it enters the point again, runs the replace again and recurses until the stack overflows. Copy
the part of the body you need into the listener instead.

### one call argument

`@ModifyArg` changes one argument of a call: a [before_call](#before_call) writing that field.

```rust,ignore
pub fn autosave(receiver: Receiver<'_, '_>, args: &mut Args) {
    args.rate = args.rate.max(20.0);
}
```

### all call arguments

`@ModifyArgs` gets them all: the same [before_call](#before_call), writing any of `args`' fields
(`autosave_interval` has one, `rate`).

```rust,ignore
pub fn autosave(receiver: Receiver<'_, '_>, args: &mut Args) {
    args.rate *= 2.0; // and any other field of `args`
}
```

### a parameter

`@ModifyVariable` on a parameter at the head is a [head](#head) listener writing that argument:

```rust,ignore
pub fn turn_angle(args: &mut mod_points::GameCommandsWrapDegreesArgs) {
    args.angle += 180.0;
}
```

### a local

`@ModifyVariable` on a local is `kind = "modify_local"`: the listener gets the binding itself, before
or after a selected call ([mutable locals](#mutable-locals-native-source-rebuild-only)).

### constants and field reads

`@ModifyConstant`, and `@ModifyExpressionValue` on a field read, are `kind = "expression"`: the
listener takes the selected value and returns the one used
([expressions](#expressions-native-source-rebuild-only)).

### wrap_call

Wraps the call: the listener decides whether and how often the original runs, and with which
arguments (`kind = "wrap_call"`):

```rust,ignore
pub fn autosave(
    receiver: Receiver<'_, '_>,
    args: &mut Args,
    original: &mut dyn FnMut(Receiver<'_, '_>, &mut Args) -> Output,
) -> Output {
    if my_mod::paused() { 0 } else { original(receiver, args) }
}
```

### wrap_if

Runs the call only when the listener returns `true` (`kind = "wrap_if"`). The call must return `()`,
so this one sits at a unit call, not at `autosave_interval`:

```rust,ignore
pub fn play(receiver: Receiver<'_, '_>, args: &Args) -> bool {
    !my_mod::muted()
}
```

### state

A `@Unique` field becomes `kind = "field"`, an extension field on a listed type. It lands with
#2582; until then it is refused with a typed reason. For data a mod keeps on game objects today,
use attachments.

### support classes

Helper classes a mixin calls become a [`[[native.module]]`](#support-modules) table: whole Rust items
emitted into a game crate, native only.

### bindings

`@Shadow`, `@Accessor` and `@Invoker` reach private members. Declare them as
[internals](#raw-listeners-and-declared-internals) and name them through the facade:

```toml
internals = [{ path = "horizon_client::game::Game", hash = "<written by the tool>" }]
```

```rust,ignore
pub fn tick(game: &mut internals::game::Game<'_>, raw: &mut internals::raw::__TickRaw<'_>) {
    my_mod::observe(&game.world_root); // a field of the declared type, reached directly
}
```

## Reference

- A point's methods are `<point>` (its head: the arguments it was called with) and `<point>_return` (after
  its body: the value it returns), in a crate-root `with` function. Its record is `mod_points::<Point>Args`.
- Depend on `horizon-mod-points` only to listen at points. It holds one record per point;
  a mod without point injections leaves this dependency out.
- A listener's host is a `HostSide` on a function that takes `&mut self`, and `&dyn Host` on one that takes
  `&self`.
- The game sets a point's slots once, after the mods are installed; a point no mod listens at costs one
  atomic load and a branch.
- A point injection's `hook`, bindings and horizon-mixins fields are refused: a hook is its own `Hooks` method,
  and the record carries what the point passes.
- `[[inject]]` has no binding or hook-version fields. Implement a catalog hook through `Hooks`;
  use the slot's generated callback signature for an injection.

### Delegated knockback entries

Knockback preserves two independently injectable function entries. The short entry calls
its full entry once with the effect flag false; a direct full-entry call bypasses the short
entry. Thus two head listeners that each double strength apply twice through the short
entry and once through the full entry. Canceling the short entry prevents the full call.
This does not add a hook: `living_knockback` remains one observation per ordinary physical
push, before resistance. Sulfur cube effect launches retain their species-specific handling.

The native internals targets are:

- `horizon_client_lib::mobs::knockback::Mob::knockback`
- `horizon_client_lib::mobs::knockback::Mob::knockback_full`
- `horizon_client::game::creatures::knockback::Game<'_>::knock_back_player`
- `horizon_client::game::creatures::knockback::Game<'_>::knock_back_player_full`

Default hurt and sweep pushes use the short entry. `causeExtraKnockback`, including both
spear pushes, uses the full entry with its corresponding effect flag. The player full entry
carries damage and the flag even though vanilla player physics does not use them.

These entries are **not admitted API points yet**. The mob receiver `Mob` has no point handle;
`DamageLevel` and `Damage` have no point mirrors. The player receiver becomes `Host`, but
`HurtSource` and `Attack` have no point mirrors. Registration refuses the first unadmitted
type on both native and wasm. General admission is tracked in
[#2767](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/2767). `access = "internals"` is native-only;
wasm refuses it at load, not a silent fallback. Native injection tests do not establish wasm
entry support while those API refusals remain.

### Mutable locals (native source rebuild only)

`modify_local` requires `access = "internals"` and a rebuild from source. It uses the
same pinned `call`, `nth` and `ctx` identity as other call-site injections, with three
required fields. `local` and `position` belong only to this kind; `type` is also used by `field`:

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "adjust_count"
at = "horizon_client::game::count"
kind = "modify_local"
access = "internals"
with = "adjust_count"
hash = "<function hash>"
call = "horizon_client::game::sink"
nth = 0
ctx = "<statement context>"
local = "n"
type = "i32"
position = "before" # or "after"
```

The callback `fn adjust_count(n: &mut i32)` receives the actual mutable binding.
Before callbacks run before evaluating the call; after callbacks run after it returns,
while preserving its result. There is no copy or deferred write-back. Listeners use
the existing priority/mod/injection ordering at each position. They may mutate the
value directly, with the same type and panic handling as native internals listeners.
No Host is passed by this raw internals route.

The initial implementation accepts direct call statements in the enclosing function
block. It refuses nested expression positions whose scope or evaluation order cannot
be proven. The binding must be a single mutable local with a matching explicit Rust
type, or a directly initialized suffixed integer literal (such as `3i32`) or boolean
literal. Unsuffixed integer literals are refused because their inferred type cannot
be proven. The declaration must include an initializer; later assignments do not
establish initialization for this analysis.
Missing, shadowed, immutable, type-mismatched, moved or borrowed bindings are refused
by name. Non-scalar uses before the position, references (including `ref`/`ref mut`
patterns in let, match and if-let over expressions mentioning the local), closures
and opaque macros are conservatively refused when their dataflow cannot be proven.
This may refuse bindings that Rust's borrow checker could otherwise accept.

API access and wasm permanently refuse mutable locals; use native internals or request
a hook. Wasm also permanently refuses call-site injections. Nothing is rewritten when
no mod declares a local injection, so an unused local injection has zero runtime cost.

### Transient native fields

`kind = "field"` adds a real public Rust field during a native source rebuild:

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "count"
at = "horizon_client::game::Game"
hash = "<target struct hash from internals.json>"
kind = "field"
access = "internals"
with = "count"
type = "u32"
```

The emitted member is `<mod_id>__<with>` (a mod id starting with a digit gets a leading underscore).
Declare the target through the existing internals facade and access the member directly,
for example `game.example__count`. A declaration colliding with an engine field is refused.
There is no listener and no runtime registration for this kind.

The field type must implement `Default` and, when the owner clones, `Clone`. Rust checks
these bounds during the source build. Types must already be reachable from the target engine
crate: standard-library types and visible engine types, using canonical engine paths.
Mod-defined types are refused by name; use attachments for them.

Struct literals initialize the member with `Default::default()`; struct update expressions
retain the member from their base. Derived Default and Clone include the member automatically.
Manual Default constructors initialize it, and manual Clone and clone_from copy it from the source.
Exhaustive patterns, macro constructions, explicit representation layouts and unsupported codec
derives refuse by target name rather than guessing how to extend them. Serde derives receive
`#[serde(skip)]`; Wire and unknown derives refuse. Explicit save and sync field lists are untouched.
The field is never saved or synced. Use attachments for persistence or synchronization.

API access and wasm permanently refuse this kind and point to attachments. No declarations means
no rewrite and zero runtime cost. A declared field adds its size (and layout alignment) to every
instance; Default and Clone perform the field type's normal operations.

Injected mod fields must not change engine equality, ordering or hashing. Targets deriving
`PartialEq`, `Eq`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord` or `Hash` are currently refused with `E_INJECT_FIELD`;
a neutral comparison wrapper is follow-up work. Hand-written comparison implementations
ignore the injected field. `Debug`, `Clone` and `Default` keep their normal field behavior.
### Expressions (native source rebuild only)

`expression` replaces one value the function reads: a literal (`64.0`, `-1`, `"name"`), a
constant's path (`MAX_REACH`) or a field read (`self.speed`). It requires
`access = "internals"` and a rebuild from source, and takes `expr`, `type`, `nth` and `ctx`;
`call`, `local` and `position` are refused:

```toml
[[inject]]
id = "farther"
at = "horizon_client::game::Game<'_>::reach"
kind = "expression"
access = "internals"
with = "farther"
hash = "<function hash>"
expr = "64.0"
type = "f64"
nth = 0
ctx = "<statement context>"
```

The callback `fn farther(value: f64) -> f64` gets the value the game would use and returns the
one it uses instead; listeners chain in the usual priority order, and no Host is passed. `expr`
is matched as Rust tokens, so spacing doesn't matter. `nth` counts the matching reads in the
function from 0, in source order, and `ctx` pins the statement it sits in, as for call sites.
Reads a value can't stand in for are not counted: an assignment's place, a borrow's operand
(`&LIMIT`) and a method's receiver (`4u32.max(1)`), along with constant contexts and nested items.

`type` is the value's Rust type: a copied scalar (`i8` … `u128`, `isize`, `usize`, `f32`, `f64`,
`bool`, `char`) or `&'static str`. A suffixed literal whose suffix differs is refused before the
build. An unsuffixed literal, a constant or a field takes the declared type as written; when the
game uses another type there, the build fails with `E_INJECT_EXPRESSION_TYPE`, naming each mod
and inject id that declared the site, the type, the expression and the function.

When the function changes and `ctx` no longer matches, the refusal (`E_INJECT_LOST`) lists every
matching read now in the function as `nth = …, ctx = "…"`, so the declaration can be fixed without
staging the game. Mods declaring the same read with the same type share one site. API access and
wasm permanently refuse it; use native internals or request a hook.
